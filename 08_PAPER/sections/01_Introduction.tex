\section{Introduction}

The Dark Vital Dimensional Hypothesis (DVDH) proposes a unified cosmological
framework combining Higgs–vacuum instability, photonic mass-loss dynamics,
geometric collapse, and dimensional bifurcation.

This chapter introduces the fundamental motivations of the theory, the gaps in
ΛCDM addressed by DVDH, and the mathematical roadmap followed in the
subsequent chapters.

We also outline the connection between microscopic (DSI) physics and
large-scale cosmological evolution through the scaling parameters $\alpha$ and
$\epsilon$.
