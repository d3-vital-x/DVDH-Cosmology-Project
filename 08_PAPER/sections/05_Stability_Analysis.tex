\section{Stability and Perturbation Analysis}

We analyze:

- background blow-up regions,
- tensor-mode divergence,
- phase-space constraints,
- equilibrium stability at early and late times.

A dynamical–systems approach is used to classify stable/unstable regions:

\[
\dot{H} = f(H, \rho_\gamma, \rho_{VX}, \phi_H)
\]

The DVDH model remains stable for:

\[
\Delta D < 0.15
\]

beyond which geometric bifurcation occurs.
