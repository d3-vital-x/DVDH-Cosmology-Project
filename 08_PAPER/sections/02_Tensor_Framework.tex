\section{Tensor Framework of DVDH}

DVDH constructs a modified geometric-tensor basis by introducing the Vital
Field $\Phi_v$ and the associated curvature contributions.

The extended stress–energy tensor is written as:

\[
T^{\mu\nu}_{DVDH}
= T^{\mu\nu}_{m} + T^{\mu\nu}_{\gamma} + T^{\mu\nu}_{VX}
\]

We describe the role of:

- vital–field curvature term,
- geometric mass–loss term,
- Higgs-vacuum drift,
- coupling modifiers in background + perturbation geometry.

This framework reduces to standard GR under the limit:

\[
(\rho_{VX}, \phi_H) \rightarrow 0
\]
